# A cookie's quest
## introduction
A Cookie's Quest is an endless 2D arcade game inspired by Flappy Bird. I created this game to release a complete project on a small scale, allowing me to become familiar with the entire game development process.
## how to play
The game centers around the player, a cookie, that constantly moves either up or down. The objective is to dodge incoming obstacles and people who are trying to stop (or eat) the cookie.
To change direction, simply tap the screen. For every obstacle or person the player successfully dodges, they earn 1 point.
